<hr><h3 id='description'>Description</h3>
The <a href='https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/redux-journal'>deployed website</a> is a simple journal which demonstrates the use of React with the Redux library, as well as a non-relational database through MongoDB. MongoDB is used to store user journal entries, and allows their persistent storage and retrieval for later use. Components that make up the front-end of the website have all been disigned using React. HTML routing is accomplished with react-router-dom, and an Express.js back-end is used for api and database functions. Redux is used to provide global state and global functions to various React components. The app is rather simple, for demonstration purposes. On this scale, Redux may not be necessary. However, with additional added functionality and size, redux can start to show its advantage in terms of ease of programming. For example, Redux may be used to pass globally needed variables to all components, such as the user authentication state. Redux can also be used to avoid the complication of prop drilling - for example, a global light/dark theme may be passed as a prop to all components. Finally, through the Redux browser add-on, debugging is made simpler through recording of app states. 

<h3 id='installation'>Installation</h3>
Simply visit the deployed website for a quick demonstration. Alternatively, if cloning this repository, necessary packages can be installed in a terminal running Node.js by using the command 'npm install'. The app can then be run in a browser, at localhost:3000, by using the command 'npm start'.
